## üíª Database Design
Key Entities and fields related include:
- **User:** Central entity for both guests and hosts
  - id: AutoField
  - Email: has to be unique
  - first_name
  - last_name
  - date_joined
  - is_host: Boolean field with a false default. To show if user has listing capabilities
- **Listing/Property:** property hosted by user:
  - id: AutoField, PrimaryKey
  - host: user who owns the listing
  - title: short catchy listing qualifier
  - listing_image: Major image advertising the booking
  - description: descrition of the property
  - description_images: multiple images advertising listing
  - address
  - price_per_night
- **Booking/Reservation:** to link guest to listing for a specified period
  - id: AutoField
  - guest: user making the booking
  - listing: property being booked. Made unavailable after booking confirmation
  - check_in_date
  - check_out_date
- **Review:** to gather guest feedback
  - id: AutoField, PrimaryKey
  - booking: to ensure one review per booking
  - author: guest making review
  - rating: ranging from one to five stars for the booking
  - comment: textfield for the author's review
- **Amenities:** provided by the listing and/or host for the property being booked
  - id: AutoField
  - name: name of amenity
  - icon: optional but better for frontend
- **Messaging:** to facilitate communication among users
  - id: AutoField
  - sender
  - receiver
  - content

- **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## üìà API Security
#### Authentication: who are you??
- first gatekeeper to ensure the user is who they say they are. This means the usage of Django's built-in authentication system and DRF's authentication classes.
#### Authorization: what you're allowed to do
- after authentication, this controls user's access and permissions allowed. This includes Object level permissions and Role-based access controls.
#### Input Validation and Data Sanitization: Never trust a client's data
- Define strict validation rules for every field and protect against injection attacks using DRF Serializer, SQL Injections(Django ORM) and Django Model Validation
#### HTTPS and Secure communication:
- enforce HTTPS everywhere and use HSTS
#### Throttling and Rate Limiting:
- Protect API from abuse and DoS attacks

## üìå CI/CD Pipeline
### What is CI/CD?
- **CI(Continuous Integration)**: is the practice of automatically building and testing every change to your codebase as soon as it is pushed to a shared repository. The goal is to catch bugs and integration issues early.
- **CD(Continuous Deployment)**: automates the delivery of code changes to the environment after they pass the CI stage.
### Contribution to this Development Process
For a complex task like this, CI/CD pipeline is important as it serves the following functions:
- Catches bugs early and improve code quality.
- Automates repetitive and error-prone tasks.
- Increases deployment frequency.
- Enables rapid rollback.
### Tools employed for CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
- AWS CodePipeline/Google Cloud Build
- Jenkins
